Create cards

* Introduction

 The main additional functionality compared to other card game simulation
 programs is that <<Magic Project>> understands the rules of the game. Rules are
 human-written using a specific XML pseudo-language, giving the <<Magic Project>>
 game engine all the necessary information to properly simulate the card game.
 For card games with static rules (like <No Limit Texas Hold 'Em Poker>), writing
 the rules file is not a too difficult task. For collectible
 card games (<CCG>), we often encounter a base set of rules that describes the
 game and one or more specific set of rules corresponding to each card.

* The game rules files

 A card game is described by a main XML file and a set of other XML files for
 each card in that game. For example, in a <<Magic the Gathering>> card game,
 you'll have a big file named <<<mtg.xml>>> in the <<<src/main/resources/tbs>>>
 directory. Each implemented cards have a dedicated XML file in the
 <<<src/main/resources/tbs/mtg/recycled>>> directory. The name of the file is
 the name of the card in English with the spaces replaced by an underscore and
 the simple quote removed. For example, for the card "<Abu Ja'far>", you will
 have the file <<<src/main/resources/tbs/mtg/recycled/Abu_Jafar.xml>>>.

* Implemented games

 For now, only the game {{{mtg/mtg.html}Magic: the Gathering}} is implemented in
 <<Firemox>>.
 
* Creating cards

 A really useful tool has been created in order to increase the XML card creation process.
 The 'oracle2xml' command allows you to create the whole XML of all cards from a text Oracle 
 file. You can get it from the regularly updated site 
 {{{http://www.yawgatog.com/resources/oracle/} here}} or from a ready to use file 
 {{{Allsets-2007-03-11.txt}there}} and place it in the directory to create <<etc>> in the 
 root directory of FM.
 Then, you can launch the 'oracle2xml' command from the root directory of FM; then, 
 have a look in the <<etc/xml>> to see the generated XML files. 
 They can be edited and moved in the <<tbs/mtg/recycled>> directory when you think they are 
 well formed and suit to the rules to have FM considering them.
 
 It's advised to build all new cards from this tool since it will save you a lot of time 
 and assure that you are creating cards the right way.
 
 PS: since the Oracle file may have a different name on the the day we created this document, you 
 might have to edit the 'oracle2xml' or 'oracle2xml.bat' command an update the Oracle file name.
