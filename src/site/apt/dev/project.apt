Configure Eclipse for Firemox 

* Get sources

** Open SVN perspective

** Create a new connection

[../images/guides/dev/svn_sources2.png]\

	Repository root : <<<https://firemox.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/firemox>>>\

[../images/guides/dev/svn_sources3.png]

** Checkout sources

[../images/guides/dev/svn_sources4.png]\

	Project name is <<<firemox>>>

* Create launchers

** How to create a launcher

 Launcher is useful to launch a Java application. For our project we'll need 3 
 launchers. 
 
 One for the application : it launches the main program and would be the most 
 often launched.

 One for the XML builder : it	force the XML <build> parsing the XML cards to 
 check syntax and build the binary MDB file. For more information about XML 
 building, see {{{../xml_building.html} this page}}.
 
 One for text transformation to XML with <<<xxx2Xml>>>. There is Oracle2Xml for 
 example that have an Oracle text 
 file as input and generates some partially completed XML card files. This 
 launcher would be used only a few times.

** Application launcher
	
	This launcher will launch <<Firemox>> as if you launch it with <<<magic>>> 
	command. But launching it from Eclipse will allow you to <debug> it.

** XML Build launcher
	
	This launcher will launch the XML card parsing to create the MDB file. Each time 
	you modify a card or some rules, the next time you launch/start the program 
	the MDB is rebuilt. 
	Nevertheless you can force this process without modifying any XML or file or 
	starting the UI program.
	
	You must run this launcher to force update the MDB. Only the MDB file
	is used by Firemox, not the XML files.

	The XML documents are validated against a XSD file defining the syntax of cards 
	but this validation is very long, and also is disabled by default.
	
	To enable it, use the following launcher :

  You can find some additional information about XML building 
  {{{../xml_building.html} there}}.

** Text file to XML
	
	As XML format may be a bit long to initialize for thousands cards, we have 
	created this wonderful tool able to generate <<all>> the cards of a game.
	This launcher will parse a given text file and create the XML card files. This 
	launcher would create a 80% completed card. only some complexes rules unhandled 
	(at this moment) are remaining for developer.
	
	You can find a compatible text file {{{http://www.yawgatog.com/resources/oracle} there in Allsets section}}.

  Full options are :
  
   <<-d>> (destination, directory) DESTINATION : destination directory of generated XML files
   
   <<-f>> (file, oracle) FILE                  : Oracle file downloaded from sites like 'http://www.yawgatog.com/resources/oracle'
   
   <<-h>> (help)                               : print this help message and exit
   
   <<-v>> (version)                            : print product version and exit
