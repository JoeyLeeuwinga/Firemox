Configure Eclipse to make cards and help Firemox : about 10 minutes (download excluded)

  There are some softwares to install and configurations to do for :
 
 	Java : the language
 	 
  Eclipse (itself) : the IDE
  
  Subversion (aka SVN) : the source control
  
  Maven 2 : the build manager

* Get Java 6.0

	Get the latest {{{http://java.com/fr/download/index.jsp} Java JDK 6.0}} from 
	the Sun site.
	
	Install it.

* Get Eclipse

	From this location {{{http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/20070927/eclipse-java-europa-fall-win32.zip} Eclipse 3.3+}}.
	
  Unzip the downloaded zip into any directory that will become your eclipse home.
  
  Launch <<<eclipse.exe>>> or <<<eclipse.sh>>>.

  Note that if you are running a modern Linux distribution, it is likely that Eclipse is either
  already installed or can be easily installed using your distribution's package manager 
  (eg. APT, yum, etc.)

* Get SVN plugin from Eclipse

  The goal of the Subversion (SVN) project is to build a version control system that 
  is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community.
  
	You can find the following SVN plugin instructions 
	{{{http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html} here}}
	
	Here you will find a screenshot tour of the Subclipse installation process in Eclipse 3.x.
	These particular screens were captured in Eclipse 3.2 running on Windows XP.

** Step 1:

	Begin the installation from the Eclipse Help menu item.

** Step 2:

	This screenshot show the screen as it initially comes up. In this case you will 
	need to change the radio button to indicate that this is a new install.

[../images/guides/dev/subclipse_install-2.png]

** Step 3:

	This screen will vary depending on the features you have installed already.
	You want to click on the <New Remote Site> button. If you are behind a proxy and 
	the Eclipse install mechanism does not work, then you can download a zipped 
	version of the update site and then click the <New Local Site> button instead.

** Step 4:

	This screen is showing the <New Remote Site> dialog, filled in with the correct 
	information to install Subclipse.
	
	Name: <<<Subclipse>>>
	
	URL:  <<<http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x>>>

** Step 5:

	When you first come back to this screen, the site you added will NOT be selected. 
	Be sure to select it before clicking Next.

** Step 6:

	This next screen shows all of the features that are available to install.

[../images/guides/dev/subclipse_install-6.png]

** Step 7:

	Click the button to accept the license agreement.

[../images/guides/dev/subclipse_install-7.png]

** Step 8:

	Confirm the install location

[../images/guides/dev/subclipse_install-8.png]

** Step 9:

	There is an Eclipse preference to turn off this next dialog. I have never seen a 
	signed feature. Not even Eclipse.org nor IBM sign their features.

** Step 10:

	Just a screenshot of the in-process installation.

[../images/guides/dev/subclipse_install-10.png]

** Step 11:

	Eclipse needs to be restarted after installing Subclipse.

[../images/guides/dev/subclipse_install-11.png]

** Step 12:

	Finally, after restarting Eclipse, the first thing you will typically want to do 
	is open the Subclipse Repository perspective where you can define your repositories.
	Be sure to also check the online help as well as the Subclipse preferences located 
	under Team -> SVN.

* Get Maven2

	Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the 
	concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, 
	reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
	
	You can install the Maven 2.x from this site :
	{{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html}http://maven.apache.org/download.html}}
	
	The minimal version is 2.0.7.

* Get m2eclipse plugin from Eclipse

  Maven Integration for Eclipse provides tight integration for Maven into the IDE.
  
	You can install the Maven 2.x Plug-in for Eclipse by using the following update 
	site from within Eclipse:
	{{{http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/}http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org}}
	
	All following instructions can been found {{{http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html} here}}
	There is a Flash demo that you can view which shows you how to install the 
	plug-in if you are unfamiliar with Eclipse's standard install mechanism:
	{{{http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/Installing_Maven_2.0_plugin_for_Eclipse.html}http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/Installing_Maven_2.0_plugin_for_Eclipse.html}}
	
	Optionally, you can see what the Maven 2.x Plug-in for Eclipse can do by viewing 
	the following demo in Flash:
	{{{http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/Maven_2.0_Plugin_for_Eclipse.html}http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/Maven_2.0_Plugin_for_Eclipse.html}}
