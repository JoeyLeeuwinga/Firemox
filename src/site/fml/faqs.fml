      <question>Why Magic-Project connects to Internet?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>When you install Magic-Project, there is no copyrighted content, and since the game you're playing can use a lot of different data, and since the data should suit to your language (English, French,...) the best thing is to dynamically get and cache them.
        <br/>Once downloaded, you can play offline since card pictures are downloaded, and attached are placed in the tbs/xxx/database.xml file.
        <br/>Also a lot of people desire to get immediatly a full database.xml file... Magic-project can import some remote data like a big txt file and convert it to a big database.xml. Currently this process is not implemented, but if you give us this file and it's corresponding url, will integrate this feature ;).

      <question>How Magic-Project manage cards pictures?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Required cards pictures are downloaded as needed in your local directory, and will never be downloaded later, unless you delete these files.
